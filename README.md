## Overview of the analysis
In this project we are analyzing the weather of Oahu, an island in Hawaii. This analysis is focused in checking the temperature in the island to address if the temperature is appropiate to open a business that sells ice creams and surf equipment. Also, we are checking the temperature in June and December to check that the weather is appropiate for the business the whole year.
## Results
* The temperature in June is great for the business with a minimum temperature of 64°F and a mean temperature of 74.9°F.
* The temperature in December tends to the lower side with a minimum temperature of 56°F and a mean temperature of 71°F so the business would experience a lower sales in December. However, over 50% of the days in December registered temperatures over 70°F which is a good temperature for surfing and having and ice cream.
* The maximum temperature registered in December was 83°F and in June 85°F which show as that the temperature is approximately stable the whole year.
## Summary
After analyzing the minimum, mean and maximum temperatures of Oahu in the months of June and December we conclude that the temperature in the island is perfect for the ice cream and surf apparel business. Also, the difference of temperatures between the two months is not that great to pose a risk of losing a lot of sales in the colder month; so the temperature in the island would permit the business to be profitable the whole year. It would be great to query information of the precipitation levels in the island to check how rain levels would affect the store. Moreover, we should check the wind speed in the island throughout the year which would affect the waves sizes and reduce the surfing activities in the island in the months were the wind is slower.
